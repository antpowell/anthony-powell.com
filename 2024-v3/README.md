# anthony-powell.com multiple implementations

The intent behind this project and repo is to create a personal portfolio site using multiple frameworks.
This will be to further my knowledge and understanding of how frameworks work and to compare and contras the differences between them.

The running list will be updated as I add new frameworks:

1. Bun
   1. Custom using Bun only
   2. Vite
2. Blazor
